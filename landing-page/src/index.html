            <h2>Welcome to <span>Japanese Domestic Market</span></h2>
            <p>
              "JDM" stands for "Japanese Domestic Market," and the history of
              JDM is closely tied to the history of the Japanese automotive
              industry and car culture in Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
              JDM refers to vehicles, parts, and accessories that are
              specifically intended for the Japanese domestic market. Throughout
              history, Japan has been a leader in car production and has gained
              a reputation for innovation, quality, and performance. Many of the
              cars made for the Japanese market offer exclusive features and
              technology that are not available in models destined for other
              markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The history of JDM can be traced back to the early 20th century
              when the first automotive companies were established in Japan.

            <p>
              In the 1960s and 1970s, companies like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and
              Mazda began to gain global recognition for the quality and
              reliability of their vehicles. Many of the iconic models from
              these brands, such as the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, and Nissan
              Skyline, became staples of the Japanese domestic market and were
              eventually exported to other countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the following decades, JDM has become a global
              phenomenon, especially among car enthusiasts and fans of Japanese
              car culture. JDM cars are appreciated for their unique design,
              advanced technology, and outstanding performance. Additionally,
              JDM has also influenced the aftermarket industry, with a wide
              range of products tailored specifically for Japanese models.

          <div>
            <p>
              In summary, the history of JDM is intricately linked to the
              development and evolution of the Japanese automotive industry, as
              well as the growing popularity of Japanese cars and car culture
              worldwide.
